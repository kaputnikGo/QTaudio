# Attempting with this file to force qtaudio access to mic via pulse deferral - not currently working
#   - hard to determine if perms are working correctly as normal openstore app installs with mic
#     access are also failing to get mic access.
#   - additional entry below of audio via pulse is taken from morph-browser apparmor policy
#   - currently webapp invokes a perms popup for mic access but it fails to do anthing
#   - $ sudo service apparmor status reports: apparmor stop/waiting
#     $ sudo service apparmor start reports: apparmor stop/waiting
#     $ service --status-all reports: [ + ] apparmor
