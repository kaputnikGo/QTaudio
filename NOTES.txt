some notes taken during process::

this app will always work against whatever the OS settings are doing...


QMediaPlayer stuff:
load and play long ogg file only sends output to current selected output device,
cannot be switched via QTaudio app. Switching back to original output has no audio now.

Assuming that QAudio has connection to one device at play. Maybe stops it?
test - load, play audio thru speakers, wait 6 secs, switch to headphones (already plugged in):
start:
    void AalMediaPlayerControl::play()
    Actually calling m_hubPlayerSession->play()
    PlaybackStatus changed to : "playing"
then at headphones on:
    [player_stub.cpp:185@operaotr()] EndOfStream signal arrived via the bus
    void AalMediaPlayerControl::playbackComplete()
    virtual void AalMediaPlayerControl::stop()
    void AalVideoRendererControl::playbackComplete()
    PlaybackStatus changed to : "stopped"
then press Stop Audio
    [nothing new added to qDebug]

closing up when its playing audio will keep audio playing...
look for pulseaudio process to kill (uh-oh, reboot)

no dsp present on device when switched to VoiceComm, maybe its only a priority signal.




to get .sh echo (and errors) use after install on device:
$ clickable --arch arm64 --ssh [ipaddr] log


schematic for postmarketOS revision on Audio page has no Mic1, only Mic2.

Mic1 daughterboard / "USB-C Small board" mic
Mic2 headphones mic
AIF1 is SoC
AIF2 is modem
AIF3 is bluetooth

so, Mic1 and AIF1 (should cause feedback with speakers on, depends on n%)::
160 == 83% == 0.00dB

//inputs
amixer sget 'Mic1' -> Capture Switch to [on]
amixer sget 'ADC' -> Capture Volume to 50%
amixer sget 'AIF1 AD0 Mixer ADC' -> Capture Switch to [on]
amixer sget 'AIF1 AD0' -> Capture Volume to 50%
amixer sget 'AIF1 DA0' -> Playback Volume to 50%
amixer sget 'DAC Mixer ADC' -> Playback Switch to [on]
//outputs
amixer sget 'DAC' -> Playback Switch to [on]
amixer sget 'DAC Reversed' -> Playback Switch to [on]
amixer sget 'DAC' -> Playback Volume to 50%
amixer sget 'Mic1' -> Playback Switch to [on]
amixer sget 'Mic1' -> Playback Volume to 50%



get volume info:
headphoneVolProcess.readAllStandardOutput(); // get stdout

add a mic control
defaults for pinephone:
  'Line In' (captures playback L/R off) off
  'Mic1' (captures playback L/R 43% off)
  'Mic2' (captures plaback L/R 43% off)
  'Mic1 Boost' (mono) 57%
  'Mic2 Boost' (mono) 57%

alsamixer defaults:
  'Line In' - playback 43 unmuted, capture [off, off]
  'Mic1' - capture L R, no volume bar at all, red
  'Mic1 Boost' - capture 64
  'Mic2' - capture [off, off]

changing via QProcess is read into amixer but alsamixer shows no change
amixer for unmute 'Line In' shows : "Playback 3 [43%][0.00dB][on] Capture [off]"

unmute turns Line In, Mic1, Mic2 capture to [on]
option cap turns on capture.
add volume % for unmute/mute commands

also mute: $ amixer -c 0 set [audio i/o] mute

amixer -c 0 set 'Line In' 75% cap unmute

speakers to 85% produce noticable line static hiss... no DSP?
no feedback with mics on and speaker on... is there DSP?
no audio at all with mics on and either speaker or headphones on

possible other device items for mic control:
'Mixer' capture [off]
'Mixer Reversed' capture [off]
'AIF1 AD0 Mixer ADC' capture [off]
'AIF1 AD0 Mixer AIF1 DA0' capture [off]
'AIF1 AD0 Mixer AIF2 DAC' capture [off]
'AIF1 AD0 Mixer AIF2 DAC Rev' capture [off]
'AIF2 ADC Mixer ADC' capture [off]
'AIF2 ADC Mixer AIF1 DA0' capture [off]
'AIF2 ADC Mixer AIF2 DAC Rev' capture [off]

for playback:
'DAC Mixer ADC' playback [off]
'DAC Mixer AIF2 Dac' playback [off]
'DAC Reversed' playback [off]
